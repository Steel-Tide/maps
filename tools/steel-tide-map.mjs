   * The fire curtain, and the glass cannon that lays it. The Drake's weapon

   * ground it washes over keeps burning for eight seconds afterwards. It is
   * the only unit that denies ground rather than killing what stands on it,
   * and the only weapon whose damage goes on after the trigger is let go.
   *
   * That second is the whole unit, and everything else about it is what the
   * second costs:
   *
   * - **A cooldown, not a reload.** The bottles come back up to pressure over
   *   2.6 s, so for two thirds of every engagement the Drake is a tank with
   *   no gun standing three tiles from something that still has one. What it
   *   set alight is what fights while it waits.
   * - **A light tank's reach.** 4 tiles (3.4 until 2026-09-16, a quarter
   *   more since, floored): level with the Wolf, a hair past the Buggy's
   *   machine gun, and out-ranged by every heavier tank, every turret and
   *   every artillery piece there is, so it still has to be walked in behind
   *   something that can take the crossing.
   * - **Thin skin over a full fuel tank.** 260 hit points of *medium* armour
   *   at Tier 2 — less than the Tier-1 Wolf it is built to burn. A Bison's
   *   gun opens it in six seconds and it rarely sees a second cooldown out.
   *   It is priced to be spent — cheaper than the Viper it eats, though
   *   300 metal since 2026-09-19 (280 before) — and it is meant to be.
   * - **Nothing for aircraft**, and a hull in the water does not burn.
   * - **The fire is nobody's friend.** A curtain a column could walk through
   *   unharmed would not be a curtain, so `force` rides on every patch and
   *   the Drake's own side burns in it exactly as the enemy does. The Drake
   *   itself burns at half (`burnMult`): it is built to work in its own
   *   fire, so driving forward into what it just laid costs it, but not
   *   what it costs the tanks beside it.
   *
   * What that buys is a raider, not a line unit. Against equal metal it eats
   * artillery, air defence, engineers' work and swarms — the things that sit
   * still or cannot answer at four tiles — and it is beaten by anything with
   * a tank gun and the reach to use it: two Bisons take four Drakes for a
   * quarter of their price. The AI does not field it, for the reason it does
   * not field the Salamander: keeping a line out of one's own fire is micro,
   * and it has none.
   *
   * Level 2 of the war factory, no radar, since 2026-09-17 (the Arsenal's
   * third unit before, behind the radar): a raider's prey — howitzers, air
   * defence, an engineer's camp — is a minute-5 thing, and by the time an
   * Arsenal stood it met Cannon Turrets and the HQ gun instead, so nobody
   * built one. The Tempest went the other way, to the Arsenal.

   * The amphibian: an eight-wheeled armoured car that swims. The one unit
   * with the `amphibious` domain — it drives on everything a tank drives on
   * and floats on everything a ship floats on, at `SWIM_FACTOR` of its road
   * speed in the water (`game/map.ts`), so a crossing is slow and the way
   * round by land is taken when it is quicker (the pathfinder weighs the
   * water, `terrCostAmphib`). Afloat it is a *ship* to every gun — a
   * torpedo, an anti-ship missile and a naval gun all find it — and ashore
   * a vehicle, judged by the tile under it (`targetCat`); it is medium
   * armour either way, and a flak gun never reaches it. It never boards a
   * transport: it is its own.
   *
   * Built at the level-2 naval yard *and* the level-2 war factory — it
   * leaves either by its own domain, the one off the slip already afloat
   * and the one off the ramp already rolling — and priced against the
   * landing it replaces. Its gun is the Wolf's class — a 30 mm autocannon, soft skins
   * and light armour, half value against heavy plate and a wall — on a hull
   * a quarter tougher, at twice the price and twice the population: two
   * Wolves beat one Gator on land, plainly, and that gap is what the swim
   * costs. Against the landing craft it is even by the metal (three Gators
   * for a craft and four Wolves) and different in kind: no beach to load
   * from and none to unload onto, no hull that takes four tanks down with
   * it, and a crossing at 44 px/s against the craft's 70. A raider from the
   * sea — the howitzer line, the air defence, the engineer's outlying
   * extractor — and a beachhead's first armour, not a line unit: a Bison
   * opens it in five shots and a cannon turret outranges it. The AI never
   * fields it; its landings go by the lift (`manageLift`), and teaching a
   * commander to swim an assault is its own job. `gator.test.ts`.
